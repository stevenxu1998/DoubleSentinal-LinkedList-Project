# DoubleSentinal-LinkedList-Project
## Description
A C++ program that allows users to store data inside of a double sentinel linked list

Other features include:
- Adding to the list
- Erasing from the list
- Copying data to a new list 
- Moving the data to a new list 
- Returning the size of the list
- Finding a specific value in the list

## Implementation
- Implemented all of the functions in the Double_sentinel_list.h file 
- The remaining .h files, .cpp files, and int.in.txt file were done by my ECE250 professor: Douglas Wilhelm Harder (Credit to him)
- Added additional test case files (i.e. edge cases) in the form of .txt files 

## Testing
- Testing was done in an linux environment 
- .in.txt files were the test case files used to test against my implementations
- The program would generate .out.txt as an output file for all the test case files
  - If a test cases passed then it would output the test case number followed by an 'okay' string    
  - If a test case failed then it would output the test case number followed by a 'failed' string
